# MangoLeafNet-XAI: An Attention-Enhanced Deep Learning Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Mango Leaf Disease Classification
## Abstract
A major challenge in agricultural automation is the detection of mango leaf disease that interferes with the quality and yield. To classify the mango leaf diseases with high precision, this work proposes a special deep learning architecture, MangoLeafNet-XAI, based on the synergistic integration of two deep learning architectures, Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) modules, and a backbone, DenseNet-121. The model is also carefully tested using a 5-fold cross-validation and ensemble methodology on three public datasets, namely, Mango Leaf Disease Identification Dataset (MLDID), Mango Leaf Disease Dataset and Harumanis Mango Leaves Dataset. It has state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.83 %, 98.09 % as well as 98.76 %. The framework is a trade-off between efficiency and performance of only 6.9 million parameters, which is suitable in situations where resources are scarce. Moreover, the interpretability of AI methods, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, that are used to explain the rationale behind predictions to offer pathological explanations, also validate the focus on clinically important aspects of the model. The results discuss the key limitations of existing methods, such as computational complexity, inability to interpret the findings, and dataset-dependent overfitting, and demonstrate a high level of resilience and generalizability on diverse data sets. MangoLeafNet-XAI will be a new benchmark for reliable, deployable, as well as accurate disease diagnosis systems, in smart agriculture.
